# Birthtimes

How long have you lived? How many seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years?

To use this app, download `birthtimes.zip` from the [most recent release](https://github.com/vmoros/Birthtimes/releases/). Extract everything from that zip. Then run `birthtimes.exe`. Then add people and their birthdays and see how old they are.
